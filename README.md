This project is a part of the thesis work of [Prairie View A & M University](https://www.pvamu.edu/) at [Electrical and Computer Engineering Department](https://www.pvamu.edu/engineering/research/). 
#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to Design and Implement Deep Learning Enhanced visualization tool for network monitoring , deploy project on Microsoft Azure cloud platform using Git actions CI/CD  pipe line.

### Methods Used
* Deep Learning 
* Machine Learning
* Predictive Modeling
* Data Visualization
* Microsoft Azure Cloud
* GitHub Actions

### Technologies
* Python
* Flask_API
* Pandas,Numpy
* Pycharm or any IDE
* HTML
* JavaScript
* Cytoscape libraries 

## Project Description

- Deep learning and Machine learning models were trained and tested using the Cyber space network dataset, and these models were seamlessly integrated with a visualization tool. Specifically, classification models like Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Deep Neural Network (DNN) were developed using Python.
- The visualization tool was developed using the Cytoscape open-source visualization tool libraries, which are built on JavaScript (utilizing the Cytoscape-Cola plug-in). The code was customized to align with project requirements, enabling the display of predicted nodes under attack through color-coded indicators, distinct line colors, and variable thickness within the interconnected node structure. To provide a user-friendly interface, a website was established, featuring the graphical representation of the visualization tool using an HTML web page.
- The integration of backend Deep Learning (DL) models with the frontend Visualization tool was achieved through Flask-API endpoints. Additionally, an advanced Deep Learning Enhanced visualization tool was implemented, and the entire project was deployed on the Microsoft Azure cloud platform using GitHub actions for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.
- One of the primary challenges encountered during this process pertained to scalability, particularly concerning network monitoring with substantial datasets containing 10,000 to 1 million records. It was observed that the frontend visualization tool's performance did not meet desired standards when handling such extensive datasets with 1 M records.
