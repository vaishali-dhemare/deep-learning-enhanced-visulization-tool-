This project is a part of the thesis work of [Prairie View A & M University](https://www.pvamu.edu/) at [Electrical and Computer Engineering Department](https://www.pvamu.edu/engineering/research/). 
#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to Design and Implement Deep Learning Enhanced visualization tool for network monitoring purpose, deploy project on Microsoft Azure cloud platform using GitHub actions CI/CD  pipe line.

### Methods Used
* Deep Learning 
* Machine Learning
* Predictive Modeling
* Data Visualization
* Microsoft Azure Cloud
* GitHub

### Technologies
* Python
* Flask_API
* Pandas,Numpy
* Pycharm or any IDE
* HTML
* JavaScript
* Cytoscape libraries 

## Project Description

- Deep learning and Machine learning models have been trained, tested on Cyber space network dataset and integrated with visualization tool. Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Deep Neural Network (DNN) models are designed for classification in Python Programming language.
- Visualization tool is developed by use of Cytoscape open source visualization tool libraries based on Java-script language (Cytoscape-Cola plug-in). Modified the code as per project requirement to show predicted nodes under attack using color coding, line color and thickness between interlinked node structure.  Website is hosted to represent the graphical interface of Visualization tool using HTML web page.  
- Integrated DL models (Backend) and Visualization tool (Frontend) using Flask-API end points. 
- Implement Deep Learning Enhanced visualization tool, deployed the project on Microsoft Azure cloud platform using GitHub actions CI/CD pipe line.
- Major Challenge is scalability, network monitoring with large datasets with 10K, 1M records as frontend visualization tool performance is not up to the mark 

## Needs of this project

- frontend developers
- Knowledge of HTML, Java-script 
- data exploration
- data processing/cleaning
- statistical modeling
- Python programming
- End-point creation using FLask-API
- Microsoft Azure Web application
- GitHub Monitoring(CI/CD) 
- writeup/reporting
